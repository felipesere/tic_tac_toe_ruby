TODO:

* Create an object 'move' or 'place' out of the combination (:row, :column)
* Remove unnecessary empty? is_marked? methods once they are no longer needed
* many references to the baords size
  - init of the hash
  - empty with magic 9
* proper hiding of methods with private
* better matcher for size of possible_moves
* possible_moves should return an array of actual moves...
